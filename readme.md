# Example Hello World WAR-File
I saw [this](http://centerkey.com/jboss/) post and build an example war file from it to test a JBOSS.

The included war-file ist build with Java 21 temurin.

## How to use?
Download the war-file from the release and copy it to the _[jboss-home]/standalone/deployments/_ folder. JBOSS will automatically delpoy the project.

Now you can check if it has worked under http(s)://[your-jboss-adress-here]/helloworld/.
